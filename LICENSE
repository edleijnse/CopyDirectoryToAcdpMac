The software is copyright and you are explicitly granted a license which
gives you, the user of the software, legal permission to copy and/or
distribute the software. In addition, you are allowed to modify the software
without restriction as long as the only reason for the modification is to place
the top-level Java package in which the source code files of the software are
located directly or in several sub-packages as a sub-package relative to a
package structure that you have defined. Other modifications are allowed but are
due to the following restrictions: (1) Every file that is part of the source
code of the software and the content of which you have changed beyond just for
the purpose mentioned above must contain the character string "@author x",
where x stands for a character string that is different from the character
string "Beat Hoermann". (2) Changes to the character string "@author Beat
Hoermann" in a source code file require the name of that file to be changed.
(3) You are not allowed to remove or change the header in a source code file
that contains the copyright and license notice. (4) Any new source code file
must contain this header.
